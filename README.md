# 5016
This file will be used as part of the course IT5016D. Each python file has the content focussed on in brackets to make searching for code easier.
For the practice tasks I kept them in one file by commenting out completed code to allow the code to run successfully. This was to save time on needing
to upload many different individual files. During my study if I need help from my own repository I can look at the brackets to find the type of code I
am looking for, if I'm working with loops, bools, variables etc.
